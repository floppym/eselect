This file contains a summary of changes in released versions.  Please read the
ChangeLog file for a more detailed listing of changes/bug fixes.

0.9.5:
    Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed nocolour handling that caused literal interpretation of '*' thus
      causing the contents of ${PWD} to be displayed instead.
    - Now recognizes the us'ian --no-color in addition to --no-colour.
    - Reverted the colours implementation to the previously used one as all
      the 'colours' calls in a sub-shell made displaying things quite slow.
    - Removed hardcoded paths to binaries that were present in certain modules.
    - Added GNU sed checks so we use the proper path thus allowing it to work
      on systems whose GNU sed is 'gsed'.
    - bashcomp module now properly supports using corresponding numbers
      (from list action) when running enable/disable action.
    - eselect bash-completion now recogizes (and completes on) global options.

0.9.4:
    Bug Fixes:
    - fixed call to lapack config file in blas module.
    
    New Features:
    - added a testing version of binutils.eselect.
    - added (start|stop|restart) subactions to rc module.
    - implemented global options handling generally and a --no-colour
    option specificly.
    - all modules mark currently active options with a * in list subaction.

0.9.3:
    Bug Fixes:
    - mailer and kernel modules: handle no targets better, show current
    selection when doing a list.
    - usage message should now always be correct.
    - support for many more symlink prefixes and suffixes.

    New Features:
    - more documentation.
    - rc module as a replacement for rc-config and rc-status.

0.9.2:
    Bug Fixes:
    - blas/lapack modules now use 'scan' subcommand over 'update'.
    - profile module now works with current profiles.desc format.
    - mailer module now works (previously broken due to typo and
      missing test in find_targets glob loop).
    - bashcomp module's show sub-command no longer returns 1.
