A Brief Overview of Eclectic
============================

Eclectic is a modular framework for writing configuration utilities. It consists
of:

* A main program named ``eclectic``.
* Various modules (``*.eclectic`` files) which carry out different tasks.
* Several libraries which help ensure consistent behaviour and simplify the
  creation of new modules.

A module provides several actions. Actions typically either display some
information (``list`` and ``show`` actions are common) or update the system
somehow (for example, ``set`` and ``update``). Each module also provides
``help`` and ``usage`` actions which explains how to use the module.

Eclectic is invoked as ``eclectic <module> <action>``. Some actions take
additional arguments -- these are added to the commandline.

Some modules install symlinks to the main program. Eclectic handles these
intelligently -- for example, it realises that ``profile-config list`` should be
treated as if the user had run ``eclectic profile list``.

Advantages for End Users and System Administrators
--------------------------------------------------

For system administrators and end users, tools written as Eclectic modules offer
several advantages over the traditional 'write each tool from scratch' approach:

Consistent user interface
    Eclectic modules provide a consistent user interface. Thanks to Eclectic's
    action framework, there is no longer any need to remember or look up dozens
    of ``-x`` style switches for each tool. The output format used by modules is
    also standardised.

Consistent help format
    All Eclectic modules provide easily accessible help documentation via the
    ``help`` and ``usage`` actions.

Consistent tool naming
    There is no need to remember dozens of ``foo-config`` and ``update-blah``
    names. To see a list of available tools, simply run ``eclectic`` with no
    arguments. Of course, the ``foo-config`` style names are still available
    (via symlinks) if you prefer.

Guaranteed Support for ``$ROOT``
    For those of you using ``$ROOT``, you will not have to worry about whether a
    particular tool can handle it. Support for ``$ROOT`` is required for all
    Eclectic modules.

Advantages for Developers and Package Maintainers
-------------------------------------------------

Writing your tool as an Eclectic module rather than starting from scratch gives
you various benefits:

Faster Development Time
    Much of the work is already done for you. Eclectic provides a series of
    libraries for common tasks, and the main ``eclectic`` program handles most
    of the hard work for you. All you need to do is provide the actions and any
    domain-specific functions you require.

Automatic Actions
    The ``help`` and ``usage`` actions are automatically generated from your
    actions, so there's no need to spend time worrying about keeping these
    written and up to date.

Easy Consistent Behaviour
    Because most of the input, output and commandline handling is split off into
    library functions, writing a 'standard' module which behaves consistently
    with other tools is very simple.

Familiar Format
    For Gentoo developers, the Eclectic module format will be very familiar --
    it is a ``bash`` file with similar structure to ebuilds.
