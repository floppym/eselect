Eclectic User Guide
===================

Introduction
------------

Eclectic is a tool for administration and configuration on Gentoo systems. It
_will_ modify the systems behaviour and should be used with care and by the
system's administrator only.

Terminology
-----------

Eclectic consists of a framework and many small bash scripts that do the
actual work, their names end in ``.eclectic``. These files are called
``modules``. Every module provides a set of functions that can be called via
the main eclectic tool. These functions are called ``actions``.

Usage
-----

Eclectic should be called as

	eclectic <module> <action> <options>

Eclectic features uniform actions among all its modules. The following are its
default actions:

* help
  Print the modules help screen.
* usage
  Print information on how to invoke the modules actions.
* version
  Print the modules version and other useful information.
* list
  Prints a set of selectable options.
* show
  Prints the currently active configuration(s).
* set
  Select one of the options offered by ``list``.
* enable
   Enable one of the module specific features.
* disable
  Disable one of the module specific features.
* update
  Gather information about the system and store it for future usage by the
  module.

A fictive default session will look like the following for most of the
modules:

    / # eclectic <module> update	(optional)
    / # eclectic <module> list
    These selections are available
      [1] <item1>
      [2] <item2>
  
    / # eclectic <module> set <item1>
    / # eclectic <module> show
    Active selection:
      <item1>
