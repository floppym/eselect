Style Notes
-----------

* Always use ``[[ brackets ]]``, never `[ brackets ]`.
* Use quotes on variables where necessary.
* For the main source, indent is four spaces, no tabs, text width of 80.
* For .eselect files, the same indenting rules apply as for ebuilds.
* Public functions don't get the ``ec_`` prefix, private functions do.
* eval is evil, so we disabled it.
