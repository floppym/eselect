blas.eclectic \- The BLAS management module for Gentoo's eclectic

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBeclectic\fR is Gentoo's configuration and management tool. It features
modules that care for the individual administrative tasks.
.SH "ACTION: LIST"
\fBeclectic blas list\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.br 
Displays an orderd list of installed BLAS implementations. It distinguishes between versions with different
Application Binary Interfaces (e.g. x86/AMD64). Further it distinguishes
between interfaces to highlevel programming languages. Each line holds
a number, the implementation's name and the providing package's name.

C/C++ profiles

  [2]   ATLAS   (sci\-libs/blas\-atlas)

FORTRAN 77 profiles

  [3]   reference       (sci\-libs/blas\-reference)


Possible \fIoptions\fR to the \fBlist\fR action are restriction to
handle only certain profiles or ABI\-specific library directories. For example,
 
\fBeclectic blas list lib64\fR

lists only BLAS implementations found in \fB/usr/lib64\fR while

\fBeclectic blas list lib32 F77\fR

lists only BLAS implementations that provide a FORTRAN 77 interface
and are located in \fB/usr/lib32\fR.
.SH "ACTION: SHOW"
\fBeclectic blas show\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.br 
Shows your system's currently active BLAS implementations.

phi / # eclectic blas show
/usr/lib      C       Active BLAS is ACML (sci\-libs/ACML).
/usr/lib      F77     Active BLAS is ACML (sci\-libs/ACML)

The same \fIoptions\fR that apply to the \fBlist\fR action can be used
with the \fBshow\fR action.
.SH "ACTION: UPDATE"
\fBeclectic blas update\fR
.br 
Browses your system for installed BLAS implementations
and save the data for further actions. During this process it automatically
detects the currently active BLAS implementation which will be memorized as well.
