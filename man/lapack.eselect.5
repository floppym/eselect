lapack.eselect \- The LAPACK management module for Gentoo's eselect

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBeselect\fR is Gentoo's configuration and management tool. It features
modules that care for the individual administrative tasks.
.SH "ACTION: LIST"
\fBeselect lapack list\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.br 
Displays an orderd list of installed LAPACK implementations. It distinguishes between versions with different
Application Binary Interfaces (e.g. x86/AMD64). Further it distinguishes
between interfaces to highlevel programming languages. Each line holds
a number, the implementation's name and the providing package's name.

FORTRAN 77 profiles

  [2]   ATLAS       (sci\-libs/lapack\-atlas)
  [3]   reference   (sci\-libs/lapack\-reference)


Possible \fIoptions\fR to the \fBlist\fR action are restrictions to
handle only certain profiles or ABI\-specific library directories. For example,
 
\fBeselect lapack list lib64\fR

lists only LAPACK implementations found in \fB/usr/lib64\fR while

\fBeselect lapack list lib32 F77\fR

lists only LAPACK implementations that provide a FORTRAN 77 interface
and are located in \fB/usr/lib32\fR.
.SH "ACTION: SHOW"
\fBeselect lapack show\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.br 
Shows your system's currently active LAPACK implementations.

phi / # eselect lapack show
.br 
Active LAPACK implementations
  /usr/lib (F77)            ACML (sci\-libs/ACML)
  /usr/lib64 (F77)          ACML (sci\-libs/ACML)

The same \fIoptions\fR that apply to the \fBlist\fR action can be used
with the \fBshow\fR action to restrict it to given ABIs and language interfaces.
.SH "ACTION: SET"
\fBeselect lapack set\fR \fIimplementation\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.br 
Sets your system's currently active LAPACK implementations to \fIimplementation\fR. 
The same \fIoptions\fR that apply to the \fBlist\fR action can be used
with the \fBset\fR action to restrict it to given ABIs and language interfaces.

phi / # eselect lapack set ACML

.SH "ACTION: SCAN"
\fBeselect lapack scan\fR
.br 
Browses your system for installed LAPACK implementations
and save the data for further actions. During this process it automatically
detects the currently active LAPACK implementation which will be memorized as well.
