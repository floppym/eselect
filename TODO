Possible TODO list. Not complete, just a collection of random thoughts for
things we might otherwise forget. More for core ideas than ideas for new
modules... Don't bother using the ChangeLog for this file.
 
Targets for 1.0.0
=================

* inherit / import functionality -- we could use some way of having a set of
  common actions for, for example, alternatives-style plugins. Probably just a
  wrapper around source and a few variables. Should be dead easy to do once we
  figure out interface details. (ciaranm)

* figure out interactive mode -- interactive should only be allowed for
  certain designated actions. We'll also need library functions for menus and
  so on. See code in config module for a rough demo. (ciaranm)

* make these modules 'undodgy': binutils,config (all)

Possible Ideas
==============

* test suite (ciaranm)

* --interactive/--ask : We could make this a global option and PUBLIC, for th
  modules to decide whether an action can be performed. (ciaranm doesn't like
  this idea)
